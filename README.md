# Pushsafer_Notfication_RPi_Aga_Temperature_Monitor
Project to record and report aga external temperature and send an alert to iphone if temperature drops.  The RPi uses is DS18B20 temperture sensor attached to the side (external) of the aga.  A second DHT11 sensor monitors the ambient humidity and temperature.  The Pushsafer app install on an iphone recieves updates (every 3 hours in daytime), alert (if the aga temp drops below threshold of 50 C), and summary of data for previous day. 
All .py files should be placed in the Raspberry Pi home directory and creat a 'Temp_log' file to store the data.
